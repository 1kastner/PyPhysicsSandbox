First need to create a Github repository with everything but this TODO file and the examples


https://coderwall.com/p/qawuyq/use-markdown-readme-s-in-python-modules
https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html
https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html

Can install py2d from the github source

# TODO: Maybe use epydoc for generating HTML documentation from doc strings?
