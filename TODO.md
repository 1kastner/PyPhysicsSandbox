# Tasks for future versions

* Create tutorials on common tasks (text and video)
    * Collision detection
    * Creating a button
    * Using slip motors
    * ?

* Generate better documentation than the monolithic readme

* Add ability to set a constant velocity for a shape

* Add ability to rotate a shape

* Work out a better way of calculating the margins outside of which a shape is removed.
  Maybe calculate those based on a bounding box of existing shapes when run () is called?
  Can default to the current setup as a minimum, but allow that to increase if shapes are
  placed outside that range initially.

* Text should draw in color

* Worry about angles being flipped?
